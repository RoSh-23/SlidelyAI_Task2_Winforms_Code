## Points to remember
1. In the submission form for new records some fields are being validated using regexes, you will be prompted when entering invalid data regarding the valid format but still explaining here:
    - Name: not longer than 60 characters
    - Email: valid email format, follow the regex "^[A-Z0-9._%+-]{1,64}@(?:[A-Z0-9-]{1,63}\.){1,125}[A-Z]{2,63}$"
    - Phone Num: Indian mobile numbers, starting from 6,7,8,9 and 10 digit long.
    - Github Link: Should start with https://github.com/
2. All the keyboard shortcuts work.
3. When using CTRL + T for toggling the stopwatch, a bell sound comes which I was not able to remove, but it still works.
4. Editable fields are name, email, phone num and github link, the stopwatch time is not editable.
